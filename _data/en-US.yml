career-profile:
    title: Professional Profile
    summary: |
      I work very well as a team, I prefer to listen a lot before I speak, I like readable code
      even though it's not the most beautiful code possible, but it makes itself understood. I work well under pressure,
      when the system crashes or the bug appears I remain calm and focus on solving the problem, I believe feedback is important.
